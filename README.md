### 💫Hi, I'm Isabel!
✏️ I am an Analyst and Administrative Support professional with experience in workflow analysis, documentation management, and process coordination. I focus on identifying inefficiencies, improving clarity in systems and processes, and supporting teams through accurate records, structured documentation, and clear communication. My work bridges technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring information is accessible, actionable, and easy to understand.

🏹 I’m highly autodidactic and motivated by learning new tools, improving systems, and creating clarity in fast-paced environments.

🧪 I also create science-based educational content for an audience of 300K+ and authored the published eBook Science Meets Beauty, where I translate technical concepts into accessible, highly visual explanations.

💞 Self-starter with a strong commitment to continuous learning, demonstrated by a portfolio of self-taught technical and analytical projects.

🌷 I have led initiatives to identify inefficiencies, modernize workflows, and create structured improvements—helping teams stay aligned through clear documentation and communication.

💭 Known for attention to detail, problem-solving, and teamwork. Experienced in supporting cross-functional teams, defining business needs, and transforming complex information into clear insights that support better decision-making.

✨ Experienced with tools such as Excel, Power BI, Salesforce, Tableau, SQL, Java, Canva, Confluence, and Python (introductory).

💌 Bilingual: Spanish (native) and English (fluent); currently improving French.
