### üí´Hi, I'm Isabel!
‚úèÔ∏è I'm a detail-oriented Business Analyst with a background in Biosciences and Systems Analysis, experienced in driving process improvements and supporting system optimization across corporate IT environments. My work includes requirements gathering, stakeholder engagement, Salesforce administration, and developing documentation solutions using tools like Confluence.

‚ú® Experience using tools such as Excel, Power BI, Salesforce, Tableau, SQL, Java, and Python.

üíû I'm a self-starter with a strong commitment to continuous learning, as demonstrated by my portfolio of self-taught projects. I'm ready to contribute to innovative solutions in fast-paced, standards-driven environments, with a strong willingness to learn and grow.

üå∑ I've led initiatives to identify legacy inefficiencies, modernize workflows, and build business cases for strategic improvements. I‚Äôm particularly effective at bridging technical and non-technical teams, ensuring clear communication, alignment, and actionable outcomes.

üí≠ Known for my eye for detail, collaboration, and problem-solving, I thrive in fast-paced settings where adaptability and innovation are key. I have experience working with cross-functional teams to define business needs, streamline processes, and implement scalable solutions that drive growth. I'm also recognized for strong communication skills and translating complex ideas into clear business insights.

üß™ While my expertise is rooted in healthcare, I‚Äôm eager to apply my skills across industries‚Äîdelivering impactful, data-driven solutions that align with organizational goals.

üíå Bilingual: Spanish (native) and English (fluent); currently improving my French language skills.
